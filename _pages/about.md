I am a PhD Candidate in Operations Research advised by prof. Jose L. Walteros (TODO link). My research focuses on decison-making in complex systems especially under conditions of adverserial interaction and uncertainty. My work focuses on strategic behavior in networked systems, using tools from game theory and optimization on graph structures to model and analyze complex interactions. I'm particularly interested in how adversaries and interdependent components shape the structure and evolution of networked systems. While much of my work is grounded in theory, I’m motivated by applications ranging from communication resilience to infrastructure defense.

Broadly speaking, I explore how to make systems more robust and adaptive. To that end, I am developing an optimization framework that draws from mathematical programming, graph theory, and computational game theory. I also explore how machine learning can support or augment traditional optimization; particularly when historical behavior offers a window into strategic preferences or inefficiencies.

Outside of academia, I have worked as a consultant on data-driven optimization problems in industry. I’ve developed software tools and modeling frameworks for supply chain logistics, and operational efficiency. In these roles, I focused on improving operational performance by increasing throughput and reducing makespan in distribution processes. At the same time, I worked on enhancing working conditions by designing solutions that allowed for more equitable task distribution, better spaced breaks, and reduced physical workload or extended hours. This experience reinforces my belief in bridging rigorous modeling with practical impact.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring. I’ve led recitations and office hours for a range of quantitative courses, helping students understand complex ideas through hands-on coding, examples, and conceptual breakdowns.
