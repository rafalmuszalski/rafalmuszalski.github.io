I am a PhD Candidate in Operations Research advised by prof. Jose L. Walteros (TODO link). My research focuses on decison-making on graph structures especially under conditions of adverserial interaction and uncertainty. I’m particularly interested in how adversaries and interdependent components shape the structure and evolution of networked systems. With an emphasis on strategic interactions on networks, my approach combines tools from game theory and optimization to model and understand complex system behaviors. While much of my work is grounded in theory, I’m motivated by applications ranging from communication resilience to infrastructure defense.

Broadly speaking, I explore how to make systems more robust and adaptive to disruption.  I also investigate how machine learning can support or augment optimization under uncertainty; particularly when historical behavior offers a window into strategic preferences or inefficiencies.

Outside of academia, I have worked as a consultant on data-driven optimization problems in industry. I’ve developed software tools and modeling frameworks for supply chain logistics, and operational efficiency. In these roles, I focused on improving operational performance by increasing throughput and reducing makespan in distribution centers. At the same time, I worked on enhancing working conditions by designing solutions that allowed for more equitable task distribution, better spaced breaks, and reduced physical workload or extended hours. This experience reinforces my belief in bridging rigorous modeling with practical impact.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring. I led recitations and office hours for several quantitative courses, supporting students’ learning with coding demonstrations, walkthroughs of exam-like problems, and accessible explanations of key concepts.
