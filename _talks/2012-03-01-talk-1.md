In a two-player interdiction game, an exploitative strategy consists of a set of moves conducted by the leader to exploit the follower's inability to play optimally. Exploitative strategies can arise when there are imbalances in the game setup across the players, such as when the follower, due to some technological limitation, is restricted to conducting heuristic moves instead of optimal ones. In this work, we formulate an exploitative framework for solving multi-level interdiction games, leveraging a hybrid deep learning optimization approach. Our framework implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) component that predicts sub-game solutions based on the structural characteristics of the game, as well as historical observations of previous iterations of the game, including the playersâ€™ previously used strategies. We show that, by sampling solutions generated by the GNN, our approach can generate an estimated characterization of the follower's decision space and use it to parameterize an optimization model tailored to produce exploitative strategies. We test the performance of our framework by solving several three-level interdiction games, including a shortest path interdiction problem with fortification.
